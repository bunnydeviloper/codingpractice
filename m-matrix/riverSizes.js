/*
Given a 2D array (matrix) (potentially unequal h x w)
Each 0 represents land, each 1 represents part of a river.
A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent
Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers
*/

Sample Input:
[
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
